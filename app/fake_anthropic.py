Talyn — Fake Anthropic client (MOCK_MODE)

Replaces anthropic.Anthropic so every endpoint returns schema-valid demo
responses. Used when TALYN_MOCK=1 (see app/config.py), so you can exercise
the API from Swagger UI and run the test suite without an
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or network access.

Two kinds of payload:

  * Static  — fixed text good enough for manual demos (encourage, insights,
              buddies, missions, study plans).
  * Dynamic — built from the prompt, for anything a test asserts *about the
              request*: how many questions were asked, which interests the
              learner has, which courses are actually in the catalogue, which
              topics need revising.

The dynamic ones matter more than they look. A static reply cannot answer
"generate a 3-question quiz" with three questions, or recommend a course
that isn't in the catalogue, so tests asserting those guarantees would fail
against the mock even though real Claude would pass them. Returning something
derived from the prompt keeps mock-mode coverage meaningful.
